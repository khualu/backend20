# Benchmarking datingsites.

## Concepts for potential dating sites
* **"LF>DATE"**, Dating site aiming for finding partners on common gaming interests or experiences.
... The concept focusses on finding common interests in the gaming world, so people can fi rst meet each other online. The first goal of finding a partner is making a "gaming date", afterwards the users can choose to possibly see each other in real life. 
* **"ANIDATE"**, dating focussed on weeb/weeaboo culture, stuff like japanese popculture, anime, manga, cosplay and japanese food.
... This could potentially be combined with the gaming dating site. 
* **"Scattered"**, the point of this concept is that you cannot post pictures of your whole body. The pictures that represent you need to be "scattered".  
* **"Sea Pool"**, based on conditions you give, the app shows you at random all the people that meet those conditions. 

## EDIT 
_I decided with doing the gaming idea. I think this idea lies closest within my interest and media knowledge. After doing some research I found out that there aren't a lot of these gaming dating sites. But I managed to find some. Also there is someone else in the Netherlands trying to develop and design a gaming [dating site called MIAI](https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/studenten-ontwikkelen-tinder-voor-gamers~ac637420/?referrer=https://www.google.com/). 

## Create a benchmark

### e-matching:
**Paid:** free + paid 
**Website**: [e-matching](www.e-matching.nl)
_The website already looks like it's meant for serious dating. Their slogan is that it's dating for people that are getting or already have at least a college degree. The first survery for registering an account is pretty thorough for something that should be engaging for users. You have to put an actual description text of yourself intead of just letting the user decide if they want to describe themselfs. This means for me that they actually want users to bond on a higher level than just looks._

###### Bot/spam protection
_At the end of the user profile there's this banner explaining why you cant contact other users yet. Seems like a good way to protect your users and website from malicious users or spam._

### Parship:
**Paid:** Yes, monthly subscription
**Website**: [Parship](www.parship.nl)
_Just by opening the website for the first time and seeing the zero-state, you can actually notice that this is more of a copmany (and thus moneymaking) than a place to try your luck. Everything about Parship looks very formal. I can understand the appeal of this, it offers some kind of authority and security about your private life._

###### Survey start

###### User profile on parship
_Every action you can take as a user sends you to the monthly subscription screen. It is interesting though, that profile pictures are **always** blurred at first, until you send a request for a chat or straight up ask for the pictures and the user gives their consent._

### Pepper:
**Paid:** Yes, monthly subscription. Just browsing for free users
**Website**: [Pepper](www.pepper.nl)
_Pepper looks a bit more playfull. The whole concept is like that aswell. The idea of pepper is to make your profile with pictures that describe you, your interest or that are you. At first sight the whole site looks free to use, but once you get your user profile ready, you notice the monthly subscription for basic interactions like chatting. It's not as expensive as Parship though._

###### Making a pepper profile

_I thought it was a nice touch to show you what you're aiming for as a user before you start the survey._
![Pepper profile example](https://imgur.com/PmA7p5f.png)

_Although the real profiles are a bit more complex and have way more information._

###### Complemting the profile
_The making of a profile for pepper is as basic as it gets. That's why after you're done, as a user you still get the chance to potentially copmlement your profile with sipmle questions._

### Gamerdating
**Paid:** Yes, monthly subscription. But some free options aswell
**Website**: [Parship](www.gamerdating.com)
_The website looks so goddamn awfull. It's just a mess. While some thing are thought out, the look and feel of the site makes the experience really bad. But it was interesting to see that there is a concept that's more or less the same._

##### Interactions 
###### Profile
_Again, wtf are those avatars on the left and right?_

###### Subscription options
![Gamerdating subscription](https://imgur.com/MzA76Sj.png)

###### Top 3 played games
_I thought this was pretty interesting. They make you choose a top 3 games, wether it's play time or just your most liked games. This gets displayed in your profile.
![Gamerdating choice of top 3 games](https://imgur.com/1kXCDGN.png)

###### Profile Survey
_It's a bit weird the site only let's you choose a "favourite" genre. Semantically I guess it's the right choice. But, people play more than only one genre. So, that's something I would definitely change._

###### Feed
_So a couple of things here. First of all, wth is that background there. It looks awfull. And apparently the dating site is not too populated. I got only two "matches" that were in Europe. But just in general, I understand they tried to assimilate their style to the gaming world, but this looks very amateuristic._
