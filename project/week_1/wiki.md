# Benchmarking datingsites.

## Concepts for potential dating sites
* **"LF>DATE"**, Dating site aiming for finding partners on common gaming interests or experiences.
... The concept focusses on finding common interests in the gaming world, so people can fi rst meet each other online. The first goal of finding a partner is making a "gaming date", afterwards the users can choose to possibly see each other in real life. 
* **"ANIDATE"**, dating focussed on weeb/weeaboo culture, stuff like japanese popculture, anime, manga, cosplay and japanese food.
... This could potentially be combined with the gaming dating site. 
* **"Scattered"**, the point of this concept is that you cannot post pictures of your whole body. The pictures that represent you need to be "scattered".  
* **"Sea Pool"**, based on conditions you give, the app shows you at random all the people that meet those conditions. 

## EDIT 
_I decided with doing the gaming idea. I think this idea lies closest within my interest and media knowledge. After doing some research I found out that there aren't a lot of these gaming dating sites. But I managed to find some. Also there is someone else in the Netherlands trying to develop and design a gaming [dating site called MIAI](https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/studenten-ontwikkelen-tinder-voor-gamers~ac637420/?referrer=https://www.google.com/). 

## Create a benchmark

### e-matching:
**Paid:** free + paid 
**Website**: [e-matching](www.e-matching.nl)
_The website already looks like it's meant for serious dating. Their slogan is that it's dating for people that are getting or already have at least a college degree. The first survery for registering an account is pretty thorough for something that should be engaging for users. You have to put an actual description text of yourself intead of just letting the user decide if they want to describe themselfs. This means for me that they actually want users to bond on a higher level than just looks._

##### Interactions 
###### News, user activities and new search options

###### Bot/spam protection
_At the end of the user profile there's this banner explaining why you cant contact other users yet. Seems like a good way to protect your users and website from malicious users or spam._

### Parship:
**Paid:** Yes, monthly subscription
**Website**: [Parship](www.parship.nl)
_Just by opening the website for the first time and seeing the zero-state, you can actually notice that this is more of a copmany (and thus moneymaking) than a place to try your luck. Everything about Parship looks very formal. I can understand the appeal of this, it offers some kind of authority and security about your private life._

###### User profile on parship
_Every action you can take as a user sends you to the monthly subscription screen. It is interesting though, that profile pictures are **always** blurred at first, until you send a request for a chat or straight up ask for the pictures and the user gives their consent._
![parship user profile](https://imgur.com/B6K6J3E.png)

### Pepper:
**Paid:** Yes, monthly subscription. Just browsing for free users
**Website**: [Pepper](www.pepper.nl)
_Pepper looks a bit more playfull. The whole concept is like that aswell. The idea of pepper is to make your profile with pictures that describe you, your interest or that are you. At first sight the whole site looks free to use, but once you get your user profile ready, you notice the monthly subscription for basic interactions like chatting. It's not as expensive as Parship though._

##### Interactions 
###### Making a pepper profile 
![Pepper profile making](https://imgur.com/9stEO0t.png)

_I thought it was a nice touch to show you what you're aiming for as a user before you start the survey._
![Pepper profile example](https://imgur.com/PmA7p5f.png)

_Although the real profiles are a bit more complex and have way more information._

###### Complemting the profile
_The making of a profile for pepper is as basic as it gets. That's why after you're done, as a user you still get the chance to potentially copmlement your profile with sipmle questions._

### Gamerdating
**Paid:** Yes, monthly subscription. But some free options aswell
**Website**: [Parship](www.gamerdating.com)
_The website looks so goddamn awfull. It's just a mess. While some thing are thought out, the look and feel of the site makes the experience really bad. But it was interesting to see that there is a concept that's more or less the same._

##### Interactions 
###### Profile
_Again, wtf are those avatars on the left and right?_
![Gamerdating profile picture](https://imgur.com/dCRhd6L.png)

###### Subscription options
![Gamerdating subscription](https://imgur.com/MzA76Sj.png)

###### Top 3 played games
_I thought this was pretty interesting. They make you choose a top 3 games, wether it's play time or just your most liked games. This gets displayed in your profile.
![Gamerdating choice of top 3 games](https://imgur.com/1kXCDGN.png)

###### Profile Survey
_It's a bit weird the site only let's you choose a "favourite" genre. Semantically I guess it's the right choice. But, people play more than only one genre. So, that's something I would definitely change._

###### Feed
_So a couple of things here. First of all, wth is that background there. It looks awfull. And apparently the dating site is not too populated. I got only two "matches" that were in Europe. But just in general, I understand they tried to assimilate their style to the gaming world, but this looks very amateuristic._

# WEEK 2
## Engine template
For this weeks assignment I started by looking at different template engines. After the first week I was already checking some of them, because I had the static site done very quickly. I checked the engines that were described in the weekly assignments. These were `PUG`, `Handlebars` and `EJS`. The research I did was a bit short. This was because I decided to do some superficial research and just start working in the engine I choose. I tend to spend too much time reaserching and then getting stuck on the actual work. I choose EJS in the end because it's the engine I've seen been used the most online and at CMDA. I found `Pug` a bit hard to follow. The same with `handlebars`. 

At first, handlebars looks very easy to use. Way easier than Pug or EJS. This tempted me at first to use this engine. But it was the installation that threw me off. Instead of using the engine in the `server.js`, you just link it in the HTML file. So I decided to skip this one. 
![HANDLEBARS EXPRESSIONS](https://imgur.com/IxRkfSx.png)
![HANDLEBARS EXPRESSIONS](https://imgur.com/GAlM1b3.png)

Everything about Pug threw me off, so this was a rather quick decision. EJS is visually way more cluttered than Pug or Handlebars, but it also makes it easier to understand what elements you're using and what you're doing. So the choice for EJS was made. 
![Pug USE](https://imgur.com/T1B0rMm.png)


## Dynamic site
So, after deciding to use EJS, I started coding away. This was an easy step to make, since the site I made already was using `express.static()`. The `server.js` needed some small changes, that are shown here:

```js
const ejs = require('ejs');

// EJS TEMPLATE SERVER
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use(express.static('src'));

// INDEX PAGE
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    // res.render('pages/index.ejs', games);
    res.render('pages/index.ejs', games);
})
// ABOUT PAGE
app.get('/about', function(req, res) {
    res.render('pages/about.ejs');
})
```

This is the structure of the project. I made the standard partials that are used with templates.

# Week 3
This is the moment where we start to build the feature that is our jobstory. Last week I worked out a couple of wireframes so that it's clear for myself what I intend to do. I noticed that what I had designed (from a UX P.O.V), was way too technical too make. I'll be making the same feature. But instead of it being in 1 page that refreshes, I will be making the feature in different `HTML/EJS` pages. 

The first step I took was reading the description of this weeks assignment for Backend, since it is a good lead to start working from that point on. So, extracted the base thought of my jobstory. The most down to base form of my jobstory would be to let users write down their favorite games, so on their turn, these games would be rendered and shown. They also would need to be (at least) temporarily saved somewhere on the server. Now that I've decided what all the functionalities were that I needed I was ready to start doing some research on how-to's and start coding. 

## The POST request
A first start at the assignment was this video. It really helped me understand the code and what I was looking for to make in `NodeJS`. The maker of the video put down a very basic form of creating a `POST` request. Afterwards I had to look for a way to also save the games that were given by the users into a `json` file. At first I tried so save it in the `server.js`, but that was not working. I guess it is possible to do this. But I found fairly soon a way to create a `games.json` and render a `ejs` partial from there. 

[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/vKlybue_yMQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlybue_yMQ "POST Request Tutorial")

```js
// SERVER.JS 
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const fs = require('fs');

// IMPORT GAMES.JSON FILE
const games = require('./views/pages/game.json');

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: true
  }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());


// POST FAVORITE GAME
app.post('/', function(req, res) {
    // console.log((JSON.stringify(req.body)));
    let testGame = req.body;
    console.log(testGame);

    saveGame(testGame, function(err) {
        if(err) {
            res.status(404).send('Game not send');
            return;
        } 
        // console.log("Your games are saved");
        // res.render('pages/index.ejs', games)
        res.send("Your games are saved");
    })
})

function saveGame(testGame, cb) {
    fs.writeFile('./views/pages/game.json', JSON.stringify(testGame), cb);
}
```

```html
	<section id="topGames">
		<h2>Your favorite games</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><%= game1 %></li>
			<li><%= game2 %></li>
			<li><%= game3 %></li>
		</ul>
	</section>
```

# Week 4

## Playground
## Different types of databases
There are a lot of different types of databases, but for the sake of long reads and time I'm gonna be naming some of the ones I know, and that would be usable for this project. 

### Relatinal databases
These databases are categorized by a set of tables where data gets fit into a pre-defined category. The table consists of rows and columns where the column has an entry for data for a specific category and rows contains instance for that data defined according to the category. The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard user and application program interface for a relational database.
![Relatinal database](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/images/112548-1532342000.jpg)

### Cloud databases
Now a day, data has been specifically getting stored over clouds also known as a virtual environment, either in a hybrid cloud, public or private cloud. A cloud database is a database that has been optimized or built for such a virtualized environment. There are various benefits of a cloud database, some of which are the ability to pay for storage capacity and bandwidth on a per-user basis, and they provide scalability on demand, along with high availability.

_This is more or less what Mongo Atlas is._
![Relatinal database](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/images/112415-1532342015.jpg)

### NoSQL database
These are used for large sets of distributed data. There are some big data performance issues which are effectively handled by relational databases, such kind of issues are easily managed by NoSQL databases. There are very efficient in analyzing large size unstructured data that may be stored at multiple virtual servers of the cloud.

_This is what I'm momenteraly using in Mongo Atlas. This is an unstructured database._

### Perosnal database
Data is collected and stored on personal computers which is small and easily manageable. The data is generally used by the same department of an organization and is accessed by a small group of people. 

_This can also be used for prototyping, until you actually need a database that can be used by bigger groups of users._

## Connect
I decided to use MongoDB Atlas, since it's always available because it's a cloud service and the choice for prototyping is totally free. I got to say, in the end it was fairly easy to connect and get data send to the database. 

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

require('dotenv').config();

// DATA BASE CONNECTION
const uri = process.env.DB_URI;
mongoose.connect(uri, {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true
}).then(() => {
    console.log('MongoDB connected...');
});

// SCHEMA MAKING FOR DB || TESTING 
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const favGamesSchema = new Schema({
    title: String,
    body: String,
    date: {
        type: String,
        default: Date.now()
    }
})

// MODEL || TESTING
const favGames = mongoose.model('FavGames', favGamesSchema);

// SAVING DATA TO DATABASE || TEST
const data = {
    title: 'Favorite game 1#',
    body: 'Overwatch'
}

// .save SAVING METHOD || TEST
const newFavGames = new favGames(data);

newFavGames.save((err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.log("Something went wrong saving the data...");
    } else {
        console.log("Data has been succesfully saved!");
    }
})
```


## Storage
Now it's time to make users be able to store data in the server and then the server to display this data.
